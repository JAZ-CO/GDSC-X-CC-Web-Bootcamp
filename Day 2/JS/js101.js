// How to know the type of a variable in JS?

/* 
   Data Types in javaScript:
   String : we use it for characters and strings.
   Number : we use it for integers and float and double.
   Boolean : we use it for true or false. 
   null : this for no value.
   undefined : this tell us that the variable is not defined.
*/

// undefined data type appears when you define a variable and do not assigne a value for it.
// if you do not assigne a value for a variable its value will be undefined but for more readability programers assing null inested.

/* 
   you can use `` (Template Literals) insted of qutes with strings and the benifit of them is that:
   it helps you to format the string.
   you can put variables inside it using ${varibaleName}.
*/

/* 
   here we will discuss things with strings:
   you cab use .length with a string to get its length.
   you can use [] to get a string element using the index which is simillar to python :).
   you can update string element using its index F.E Name[0] = "a" .
   you can add to strings using + or a string and any variable.
   you can use += short cut in javaScript.
   javaScript have escape characters which you can use with strings like t\, n\.
   if you want to use single or double qutes in strings you need to put \ before them.
   and you can also use double qutes to put inside them single qutes and the opposite also right.
   and if you want to use \ inside string you should write \\.

   to determine that data type is an array use Array.isArray(name).
   2d Arrys exists in javaScript :).
